==== ABOUT ====

Silo stores and retrieves data in an (almost) arbitrary tree of
URLs on a web server.  It is very similar to a file system.  It was
written to provide data storage for LSL scripts in Second Life.
However, it is general enough to be used from other languages and
systems, and to even store other kinds of data.  (Though LSL can
only access text.)


==== INSTALLATION ====

Silo is installed on a web server that runs PHP.  You need PHP
version 4.3.0 or later.  The instructions here are for the Apache
web server and work with version 1 or 2 of the server.

The installed silo script will have a "base URL" that is the start
of the storage tree.  It will be highly dependent on your server
configuration and the method you choose for installation.  This
base URL is the access point to your silo.

1) Pick a directory that can be served by the Apache web server.
You might want to make a subdirectory just for silo.

2) Put the file silo.php in that directory.

3) Create a directory called data, and make sure that its permissions
are set so that the Apache server can write to it.  It's not
unreasonable to simply make it writable by all.  After all, that
is what you are doing by deciding to store data via HTTP anyway!

4) Depending on how your Apache server is set up, you may need
changes to the Apache configuration.  Here are some examples of
common Apache set-ups, but more complicated ones are certainly
possible.


    Configuration 1: Under the document root
    ----------------------------------------
    Apache's config file contains:
        DocumentRoot /var/www/htdocs
    
    You create the directory:
        /var/www/htdocs/sl-stuff
    
    Place silo.php there, and create data there with full permissions.
    
    The base URL for the silo will be:
        http://www.example.com/sl-stuff/silo.php
    
    
    Configuration 2: In user's public-html dir
    ------------------------------------------
    Apache's config file contains:
        UserDir public_html
        
    You create the directory:
        ~you/public_html/sl-stuff
    
    Place silo.php there, and create data there with full permissions.
    
    The base URL for the silo will be:
        http://www.example.com/~you/sl-stuff/silo.php
    
    
    Configuration 3: Outside the document tree
    ------------------------------------------
    Apache's config file contains:
        Alias /silo/ /var/sl-stuff/silo/silo.php/
        <Directory /var/sl-stuff/silo>
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
    
    You create the directory:
        /var/sl-stuff/silo
    
    Place silo.php there, and create data there with full permissions.
    
    The base URL for the silo will be:
        http://www.example.com/silo
    
    Note that in this configuration, the directory needn't be under
    the document root, or the mapped user directories.  It is the
    Alias directive that maps the directory, and provides the nice,
    clean base URL.

5) Test the set up by copying the files test.py and uuid.py to any
machine that has python installed.  It needn't be the same machine
as the server.  In a command shell, change to the the directory
with test.py and uuid.py, and run:

    python test.py <baseURL> -v

Replacing <baseURL> with your actual base URL.  Note: This URL does
NOT end in a slash.

This should report that it passes all the tests.  If not, something
might be wrong with your configuration, or there may be some
incompatibility between the script and your system.  If you suspect
the later, let me know the details!


==== CONCEPTS ====

Data is stored at paths under the base URL.  There are some
restrictions on the path:
    - the path components can contain only characters in the set:
        - + _ % 0-9 a-z A-Z
      Note that URL encoding any string meets these requirements,
      as does calling LSL's llEscapeURL function.
    - there must be at least one path component
    - there can be no more than 11 path components

For example, any of these are valid paths:
    /tuna+fish
    /007
    /fruit/apple
    /fruit/apple/fuji
    /fruit/apple/gala
    /fruit/banana
    /9c84d7e2-713f-4269-a27b-14b133a0ec56

Notice that unlike most file systems, you can store data at both a
path ("/apple"), and at paths below it ("/apple/fuji").

Using a UUID (or key in LSL) gives silo some optionally strong
security.  Since keys are unguessable, when store a tree of data
under a path starting with a key, there is no way for anyone to
access that data, unless you give them the key.


==== USE ====

Data is stored and accessed via standard HTTP methods with a path:
    GET - fetch data at the path
    PUT - store data at the path
    DELETE - remove data at the path

When you end a path in a slash, these methods can be used:
    GET - fetch a list of path parts under this one, one per line
    DELETE - delete all paths under this one

When storing data (PUT), you must be sure that both the 'content-type'
(MIME Type) and 'content-length' headers are set.  When accessing
from LSL, these are automatically set.

All operations will return a non-error status (2xx) if the operation
completed correctly.  For the PUT operation, you can use the status
code to discover if the path was newsly created: It returns
201 in that case.

There is no need to store data a intermediate nodes before writing
something lower down.  If you are storing at "/apple/fuji", you
needn't have stored anything at "/apple".

Note that you cannot use a path of just "/".  This means that no
one can delete the entire silo, nor can anyone find out all the
paths in the silo.  Because of this, if you use an unguessable UUID
as the first path component, other users of the same silo cannot
access your data unless you give them the UUID.


---- From LSL ----

You can make access easier by setting up this global:
    string gBase = "http://www.example.com/silo";
    
Storing data:
    string data = "something to store";
    llHTTPRequest(gBase + "/apple", [ HTTP_METHOD, "PUT" ], data);

Fetching data:
    llHTTPRequest(gBase + "/apple", [ ], "");
    ...
    http_response(key req, integer status, list meta, string content)
    {
        if (status != 200) {
            llOwnerSay("there was a problem: status = " + (string)status);
        }
        else {
            data = content;
        }
    }

Deleting data:
    llHTTPRequest(gBase + "/apple", [ HTTP_METHOD, "DELETE" ], "");


If you want to use the method of storing your data under a key,
then you can set things up like this:
    string gSilo = "http://www.example.com/silo/";
    string gBase;
        
    initBase() {
        string aKey;
        
        aKey = (string)llGetInventoryKey("storage key");
            // make a notecard and add it to the inventory of each
            // object that is accessing this data.  be sure the owner of
            // the objects have modify, copy and transfer permissions
            
    // or
        aKey = (string)llGetKey();
            // only if this is not the root prim (otherwise the object key
            // can be scanned for, be sure also that this prim doesn't talk
            
    // or
        aKey = "9c84d7e2-713f-4269-a27b-14b133a0ec56"
    
    // but never
        aKey = (string)llGetOwner();
            // as the avatar keys are easily obtained
        
        gBase = gSilo + "/" + aKey;
    }

---- From CURL ----

If you have access to 'curl' from a command shell, you can try out the
silo easily using curl:

    SILO=http://www.example.com/silo
    
    # Storing data
    echo "some data" | curl --data-binary @- -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' $SILO/apple
    
    # Fetching data
    curl $SILO/apple
    
    # Deleting data
    curl -X DELETE $SILO/apple
